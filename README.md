Our game for Bear Jams Fall 2021: Inconsistent Dash

Inconsistent Dash is a fast-paced hyper-casual game made by 3 UC Berkeley students and 1 U of M student in 45 hours with no 3rd-party assets for the GDDAT Berkeley Bear Jam (Nov. 5-7, 2021). Being a 2D platformer inspired by the classic hit Geometry Dash the player controls a square using the arrow keys, along with clicking via a computer mouse(pad) to click through text scenes. However, unlike its inspiration game, Inconsistent Dash is consistently inconsistent (which is inconsistent since game jam participants shouldn’t upload a consistent game for an Inconsistent themed game jam)! 

To enjoy the game to its fullest make sure to pay careful attention to the level objectives and just have fun with it!
